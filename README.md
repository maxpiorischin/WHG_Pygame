# WHG_Pygame
This is my first Python Project involving Pygame! This has been a school assignment given to me to be completed under 3 months, so I kept the game very simple and down to 3 levels. The "Manual" on the main menu does not work properly as it leads to a google sites page backed up by the school board, so only students may access it. This project required a lot of learning of new concepts, so it may seem a little rough around the edges in certain areas. Overall, this was just a really fun new project for me to create and I had fun implementing new things I have learned!
